# Ask user for their name
name = input("What's your name? ")

# Say hello to user
print("Hello, " + name)
# or
# the comma automatically adds a space

print("Hello,", name)

# or with "f" in the beginning
print(f"Hello, {name} format")

# if you use single quotes on the outside then you can use 
# double quotes on the inside
print('Hello, "friend"')
# or this way
print("Hello, \"friend\"")
